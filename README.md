# Gasoline Prediction

# Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on fuel price data sourced from Tankerkönig. The raw datasets are not included due to licensing restrictions but can be provided upon request.

## Directory Structure & Notebook Descriptions

### 01\_Data\_Pipeline.ipynb

In this notebook, the end-to-end data preparation workflow is demonstrated. Raw data is loaded and checked for completeness and consistency. Missing values are handled, data formats are standardized, and outliers are identified and documented. Finally, the cleaned datasets are exported for subsequent analysis steps.

### 02\_Summary.ipynb

The second notebook provides a descriptive overview of the processed data. Key statistics such as means, medians, and distribution measures are calculated and presented in clear tables. Initial visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots) are generated to reveal patterns and anomalies, laying the groundwork for deeper analytical investigations.

### 03\_Analysis.ipynb

The third notebook conducts an in-depth examination of the data. Statistical tests are performed, correlations between variables are analyzed, and simple forecasting models are developed and evaluated. Results are interpreted in the context of the original questions to derive actionable insights.

### Graphs/

The **Graphs/** folder contains all figures generated by the notebooks in PNG format. Each file is named according to its respective notebook and analysis type for easy reference.
