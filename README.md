# Gasoline Prediction

# Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on fuel price data sourced from Tankerkönig. The raw datasets are not included due to licensing restrictions but can be provided upon request.

## Directory Structure & Notebook Descriptions

### 01\_Data\_Pipeline.ipynb

In this notebook, the end-to-end data preparation workflow is demonstrated:

1. **Loading Raw Data**

   * Fuel price data from Tankerkönig
   * External oil price data fetched via the `yfinance` library
2. **Data Validation & Cleaning**

   * Checking for completeness, consistency, and handling missing values
   * Standardizing data formats and timestamps
   * Identifying and documenting outliers
3. **Exporting Cleaned Data**

   * Saving processed datasets for subsequent analysis steps

### 02\_Summary.ipynb

The second notebook provides a descriptive overview of the processed data. Key statistics such as means, medians, and distribution measures are calculated and presented in clear tables. Initial visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots) are generated to reveal patterns and anomalies, laying the groundwork for deeper analytical investigations.

### 03\_Univariate\_Analysis.ipynb

This notebook focuses on univariate modeling of fuel prices. The structure mirrors that of the multivariate analysis:

1. **Descriptive Analysis**

   * Examination of individual time series properties (trend, seasonality)
2. **Model Development**

   * Building simple forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing)
3. **Model Evaluation**

   * Assessing model performance with error metrics and validation strategies
4. **Interpretation**

   * Discussing forecasting accuracy and potential improvements

### 04\_Multivariate\_Analysis.ipynb

In this notebook, multivariate models are developed by incorporating additional explanatory variables (e.g., oil price series from yfinance):

1. **Feature Exploration**

   * Analyzing correlations between fuel prices and external factors
2. **Model Development**

   * Building multivariate forecasting models (e.g., VAR, multivariate regression)
3. **Model Evaluation**

   * Comparing multivariate models against univariate benchmarks
4. **Interpretation**

   * Evaluating the impact of explanatory variables and drawing actionable insights

### Graphs/

The **Graphs/** folder contains all figures generated by the notebooks in PNG format. Each file is named according to its respective notebook and analysis type for easy reference.

## Data

* **Availability:** Raw data is available upon request.
* **Data Source:** Tankerkönig fuel station price data; additional oil price series retrieved via `yfinance`.
